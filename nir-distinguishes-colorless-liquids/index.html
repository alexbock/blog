            <p>
                This is a near infrared false color composite of water,
                76% ethanol (aq), 91% isopropanol (aq), and acetone.
                The red, green, and blue channels of this image represent the
                1000 nm longpass, 850 nm longpass, and visible frames respectively.
                These images were captured using a Sigma sd Quattro with no IR filter
                and a custom near infrared lens, the same setup used in my previous
                post demonstrating that
                <a href="../nir-water-red-wine-comparison/index.html">
                    red wine is transparent to near infrared light
                </a>.
            </p>

            <p>These are the visible, 850 nm longpass, and 1000 nm longpass source images:</p>
