                The following image compares a glass of water (left)
                and a glass of red wine (right) in visible light
                and near infrared light. The reference lines drawn
                on the background are positioned to be visible behind
                the liquids after refraction to judge transparency.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the visible light image, the distorted lines are clearly visible
                through the water, while the wine is completely black.

            alt="Three frames stacked vertically each showing a side by side comparison of water and red wine in visible light, with an 850 nm longpass filter, and with a 1000 nm longpass filter">

            <p>
                The red wine is opaque in visible light, but it becomes transparent
                in near infrared light longer than 850 nm. The transmission of the red
                wine in the infrared appears almost identical to that of the water.
                The water itself appears slightly dark in the 850 nm longpass image due to
                its absorption of some infrared light. In the 1000 nm longpass image, both
                liquids are still transparent enough to see the refracted view of the
                reference lines in the background, but the infrared absorption of water
                becomes significant enough to render it very dark.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                All three images were taken with a Sigma sd Quattro using the custom
                near infrared camera lens I described making in a
                <a href="../mini-projects-1/index.html">previous post</a>.
                The image labeled "Visible" was taken with the camera's infrared-blocking
                filter installed. The two near infrared images were taken with the infrared-blocking
                filter removed. The image labeled "NIR 850" was taken with an 850 nm longpass filter
                (Thorlabs FGL850M). The image labeled "NIR 1000" was taken with a 1000 nm longpass filter
                (Thorlabs FELH1000).
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that although both filters are longpass filters, the
                Sigma sd Quattro sensor drastically declines in sensitivity between 850 nm and 1000 nm.
                The longer near infrared light detected with a longer exposure in the 1000 nm longpass
                image does not appreciably contribute to the 850 nm longpass image.
