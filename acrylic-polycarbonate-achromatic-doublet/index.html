            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                One of the primary limitations associated with lenses and telescopes I previously
                <a href="../3d-lenses/index.html">made using a 3D-printed mold and cast epoxy resin</a>
                is chromatic aberration. Correcting chromatic aberration using an achromatic doublet
                requires a pair of lenses made of two materials that differ sufficiently in dispersion.
                (For traditional glass lenses, these are low-dispersion crown glass and high-dispersion
                flint glass.)
                The simplest choices for casting are epoxy resin, UV-cured acrylic resin, and polyester resin.
                I did not find any pair of these to provide an appropriate solution. Any of them could act
                as a stand-in for crown glass, but none of them have significantly higher dispersion like
                flint glass.
            </p>
            <p>
                Evaluating the optical properties of common plastic materials, polycarbonate stands
                out as a good replacement for flint glass. Acrylic and polycarbonate are both readily
                available in the form of inexpensive, fully transparent sheets or blocks with any desired
                thickness. The simplest way to make a homemade achromatic doublet from scratch then appears
                to be milling lenses out of acrylic and polycarbonate stock.

            <h2>Milling</h2>

            <p>
                I am using a 3-axis CNC mill with a 1/8" carbide ball end mill for both rough cuts and
                finishing on the lenses surfaces for both materials. Running two parallel finishing passes
                (one across X and one across Y) at 5% stepover has produced surfaces that are smooth enough
                to polish. The milled lenses are polished by hand using sandpaper,
                progressing from 400 to 3000 grit for acrylic and from 220 to 3000 grit for polycarbonate.
                Both are finished with cerium oxide slurry on a cotton ball to yield a polished surface.
                The acrylic lenses polish very easily, while the polycarbonate lenses require more effort.
                It may be worth finishing the latter at 1% stepover to improve the initial milled finish
                before polishing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Milling double-sided lenses, particularly double convex lenses, is an interesting
                situation:

            <img src="2-double-sided-lens-milling.jpeg"
            alt="Photograph of two sides of a double convex lens still attached to a thick acrylic sheet" width="100%">
            <p>
                The double convex lens shown above required almost the entire thickness of the 1/2" acrylic stock it
                was cut from. The side shown facing down was cut first, then the acrylic was flipped and the second
                convex surface was cut. At the end of this process, the lens was attached to the stock by only a
                very thin layer remaining at the edge between the two surfaces. After the top surface was finished,
                the mill cut the lens free with one final circular pass.
            </p>
            <p>
                After two-sided milling from acrylic and polycarbonate sheets and polishing, these
                two double-sided lenses were produced:

            alt="Photograph of acrylic and polycarbonate lenses" width="100%">
            <img src="4-side-by-side-b.jpeg"
            alt="Photograph of acrylic and polycarbonate lenses" width="100%">

            <p>
                The surface finish on the acrylic lens (left) is clearly better than
                the polycarbonate lens (right). Future polycarbonate lenses will require
                more polishing time.

            <h2>Optical Design</h2>
            <p>
                While I was initially tempted to make a simple Littrow doublet, these would
                be best prepared with the two lenses sealed together with mineral oil in between.
                As I did not want to introduce this extra detail into the first attempt, I opted
                for an air-spaced Fraunhofer doublet instead. The surfaces were optimized to
                aspherical shapes as this process can produce aspherical lenses just as easily as
                spherical ones.
            </p>

            alt="Achromatic doublet lens diagram" width="100%">
            <p>
                The assembled lens can be seen below. Note that the front element has a diameter
                of 50 mm while the rear element is only 48 mm.
            </p>

            alt="Photograph of assembled acrylic and polycarbonate doublet" width="100%">
            <img src="6-doublet-b.jpeg"
            alt="Photograph of assembled acrylic and polycarbonate doublet" width="100%">

            <p>
                The haze visible when looking through the doublet is due to the
                insufficiently polished polycarbonate lens. Below, the achromatic doublet with
                120 mm effective focal length is shown side-by-side with a 120 mm focal length plano-convex
                acrylic singlet produced by the same process. The doublet (left) should achieve
                the same clarity as the polished acrylic singlet (right) after improving the
                polish on the polycarbonate lens.
            </p>

            <p>
                I expect that with some refinement, this process can be used to produce
                homemade multi-element camera lenses and telescope objectives.
