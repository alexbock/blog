            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>
            I visited four national parks last week, enjoying uncharacteristically
            warm fall weather while hiking at Grand Teton, Yellowstone, Glacier, and Mount Rainier.
            The trip started with a flight to the Jackson Hole airport in Grand Teton National Park.
            This was followed by a short drive to Yellowstone National Park, a several hour drive to Glacier
            National Park, and a long drive to western Washington. I ultimately departed from
            Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
            </p>

            <h2>Grand Teton National Park</h2>
            
            <p>
            The view from Jackson Lake Lodge was excellent:

            alt="View of the sun setting behind the Tetons" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>Living up to its name, Moose Pond near Jenny Lake was host to a moose:</p>

            <br><br>

            <p>All visitors to Grand Teton are obligated to mill about in the cold for an hour
                around sunrise at Oxbow Bend. Not pictured: approximately twenty photographers
                setting up tripods at any conceivable place to stand along the river, the paved
                road ten feet behind me, and the crowd of smartphones shooting distant mountains
                using a flash from the nearby parking lot.

            <h2>Yellowstone National Park</h2>

            <p>While driving through Yellowstone, I encountered a
                positively valenced traffic jam; bison regularly graze near and cross
                the park roads:
            </p>
            <img src="y-bison.jpeg"
            alt="Photo of a bison herd" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>Although one is of course obligated by Yellowstone tradition to check out Old Faithful,
                the crowd can be avoided thanks to the Upper Geyser Basin Observation Point Trail:
            </p>
            <img src="y-old-faithful.jpeg"
            alt="View from above of old faithful erupting, surrounded by a crowd" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>
                At the beginning of an early morning hike on the West Thumb Overlook Loop Trail,
                I was greeted by the highly unsettling shriek of an elk:
            </p>
            <img src="y-elk.jpeg"
            alt="Photo of a male elk" width="100%">
            <p>and a chilly morning view of the lake and woodland geysers:</p>
            <img src="y-morning.jpeg"
            alt="Photo of a male elk" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>The geyers near the Grand Prismatic Spring constantly produce copious amounts of steam:</p>
            <img src="y-steam.jpeg"
            alt="Photo of steam from geysers near Grand Prismatic Spring" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>
                I made a brief stop at the very crowded viewpoint for the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone
                which has some nice waterfalls:
            </p>
            <img src="y-gc-1.jpeg"
            alt="Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone Upper Falls" width="100%">

            alt="Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>
                On my last night at Yellowstone, I went out to the lake at night and enjoyed a clear, dark sky
                with the Big Dipper over the water:
            </p>
            <img src="y-lake-big-dipper.jpeg"
            alt="The Big Dipper in the sky" width="100%">

            <h2>Glacier National Park</h2>

            <p>
                On my first day at Glacier National Park, I drove Going-to-the-Sun Road from West Glacier to
                Saint Mary and back, stopping in many places to enjoy the view or go on a short hike:
            </p>
            <img src="g-overview.jpeg"
            alt="Photo from a viewpoint in Glacier National Park" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>I noticed during the drive that the large Logan Pass parking lot was completely full,
                and decided that I would start off before sunrise the next day to park there and
                hike to Grinnell Glacier Overlook.
                Due to construction, Going-to-the-Sun road did not open until 6 AM. I arrived at Logan
                Pass and headed across the road to the trail as several other vehicles started arriving:
            </p>
            <img src="g-dark.jpeg"
            alt="Logan Pass early in the morning" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>
                Shortly after the sun came out, a wall of opaque fog rapidly rolled into the valley:
            </p>
            <img src="g-fog-1.jpeg"
            alt="Glacier National Park with fog" width="100%">
            <p>
                The fog lent a unique character to some of the trail's ledges. Is a narrow path between
                a rock wall and a sheer drop more unsettling or less when impenetrable fog blocks the view
                of how high up you are?
            </p>
            <img src="g-fog-2.jpeg"
            alt="Glacier National Park rock ledge with fog" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>
                The fog did not overstay its welcome, disappearing just as quickly as it had come
                before the novelty could wear off. The view was mostly clear for the rest of the hike:
            </p>
            <img src="g-mid.jpeg"
            alt="Glacier National Park view from Highline Trail in the morning" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>
                After almost eight miles one way and couple thousand feet of total elevation gain,
                the sudden view over the saddle at Grinnell Glacier Overlook was worth it:
            </p>
            <img src="g-overlook.jpeg"
            alt="Grinnell Glacier Overlook at Glacier National Park" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>
                As the sun just began to peek out, I turned around to look back at the valley
                and had the incredible luck to see a very clear rainbow over the heart of Glacier National Park:
            </p>
            <img src="g-rainbow.jpeg"
            alt="Rainbow at Glacier National Park" width="100%">

            <h2>Mount Rainier National Park</h2>

            <p>There are several different sections of Mount Rainier National Park. The most popular
                section is called Paradise, and someone who intends to "go to Mount Rainier National Park"
                without further context should probably set their GPS to the
                "Henry M Jackson Memorial Visitor Center".
            </p>

            <p>
                I decided to check out one of the less traveled
                sections of the park instead, Mowich Lake. After driving down half of a long,
                unpaved road, I was greeted with a peek of Mount Rainier:
            </p>

            <img src="mr-far.jpeg"
            alt="Photo of Mount Rainier from Mowich Lake" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>
                However, this was the last I saw of the mountain, as the remainder of the unpaved
                road headed into dense woods to the Mowich Lake Campground with a tranquil view of the lake:
            </p>

            <img src="mr-mowich.jpeg"
            alt="Photo of Mowich Lake" width="100%">

            <br><br>

            <p>
                The next day, I set out early for the Paradise entrance to ensure I could find
                parking as I expected it would fill up quickly on a temperate Saturday. I hiked
                to Pebble Creek and then continued about halfway to Camp Muir before the wind and
                snow at high elevation convinced me to return in the future equipped more appropriately.
            </p>

            <p>The trail provided excellent views of Mount Rainier:</p>

            <h2>Camera Details</h2>
            <p>
            All photos on this page were taken with an iPhone 14 Pro except the
            elk, the moose, and the first photo of Oxbow Bend which were taken
            with a Sony A7R III (50 mm &#402;/1.8). I tried to minimize the time I spent behind
            a camera instead of hiking, and managed to keep the A7R III in my bag -
            except for the wildlife (which simultaneously required reach and resolution
            where my phone can only provide one of these at a time) and Oxbow Bend at sunrise
            (where, as previously stated, one is obligated to huddle with every other photographer
            in Yellowstone to observe both the sunrise and the planet's largest concentration of
            graduated neutral density filters).
            </p>

            <p>
                The photo of the Big Dipper was a 3-second handheld iPhone "Night mode" shot.
                This could not compete with astrophotography done using a full-frame camera
                on a tripod, but as they say, "&#402;/6.2 equivalent and be there for three seconds".
                Not bad for a device that fits in your pocket while you stroll around a lake.
            </p>

            <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

            <img src="map.png"
            alt="Map of trip destinations" width="100%">

            <p>
            Glacier National Park was the highlight of the trip for me; I highly recommend visiting.
            The overall route was great if you don't mind the two long drives. I did not see any bears during
            my trip, but most of the hikes in the three eastern parks are in territory where carrying bear spray
            is prudent.
