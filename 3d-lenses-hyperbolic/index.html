            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Two common topics that often arise when photographers chat about fast
                lenses are the famous Zeiss 50 mm &fnof;/0.7 lens and the commonly repeated photography
                "folklore" that the maximum possible f-number for a lens is &fnof;/0.5.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Zeiss 50 mm &fnof;/0.7 continues to be admired for its large maximum aperture because
                even more than fifty years after its short custom production run, there are no lenses
                matching this speed commercially available for photographic use on standard full-frame
                camera bodies. The fastest autofocus lenses available for DSLR and mirrorless cameras
                have &fnof;/1.2 or &fnof;/1.0 maximum apertures. Several manual focus lenses with &fnof;/0.95 maximum
                apertures are also available, but entries in this category are either moderately expensive
                novelties with poor image quality wide open, or sharp wide open but exceptionally expensive
                statement pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the often-claimed f/0.5 limit, I imagine that long ago a photographer may have
                asked someone how large the aperture of a lens could be,
                and received an answer in the spirit of "For a lens that is practical to manufacture,
                the limit is f/0.5.", which lost its nuance in every retelling until
                it took the form often encountered today. The key aspect
                forgotten over time in this hypothetical origin story is the constraint on being "practical".
            </p>
            <h3>Starting With Spheres</h3>
            <p>
                What makes a lens practical?
                First, historically, the constraint that a lens is practical to manufacture would
                imply that the lens uses only spherical surfaces. One would also expect
                the lens to be made of glass and used in air (as opposed to underwater or in an oil
                immersion microscope). From these axioms, the lensmaker's equation can be used to
                find the maximum aperture geometrically possible for a spherical lens in air made
                of glass with a given refractive index.
            </p>
            <p>
                The maximum possible diameter <span class="var">D</span> of a single spherical
                lens surface is twice its radius of curvature. This is a direct geometrical
                limitation. The shape of a spherical lens surface is a slice cut off of a sphere
                whose radius is the lens surface's radius of curvature. The diameter of the resulting
                lens surface is determined by how far from the center of the sphere this slice
                occurs. The largest possible lens surface diameter is obtained by cutting the sphere
                in half exactly at the center, giving the lens surface the shape of a full hemisphere
                and a diameter equal to the diameter of the sphere (which is twice the radius of
                curvature). Simply,
                <span class="var">D</span><span class="sym">=</span><span class="num">2</span><span class="var">R</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept of a lens with the largest possible aperture can be equivalently
                thought of as a lens with the largest possible diameter for a given focal length,
                or as a lens with with the shortest possible focal length for a given diameter.
                This last phrasing in particular suggests that we consider a lens with two strong,
                convex surfaces to achieve the minimum focal length.
                (A "strong" surface here
                meaning a surface with a small radius of
                curvature and a corresponding short focal length.)
                Further, as both surfaces of this biconvex lens have the same diameter
                and each has the smallest possible radius of curvature, then the two surfaces will be
                equivalent to each other meaning the lens is more specifically equiconvex.
                As we are dealing with an equiconvex lens and have now determined that each surface is
                a hemisphere, the complete lens will be an entire sphere (generally called a "ball lens"
                to distinguish it from all other spherical lenses).

                If we start with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens#Lensmaker's_equation">lensmaker's equation</a>
                and the knowledge that we are constructing
                a equiconvex lens, then
                for a lens with focal length <span class="var">f</span> made of material with a

                At which point we find that the f-number of a ball lens depends only
                on the index of refraction. (Note that <span class="var">R</span>
                does not disappear in this manner when moving beyond the realm of
                photography and calculating numerical aperture instead of f-number.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Taking the limit of
                <span class="var">N</span><span class="sym">(</span><span class="var">n</span><span class="sym">)</span>
                as <span class="var">n</span> approaches &infin; using L'H&ocirc;pital's rule immediately yields
                the result that no matter how high the index of refraction of the material is, the maximum possible
                f-number for the ball lens would be limited to f/0.25. In practice, the refractive index of real materials
                that transmit visible light fall rather short of approaching infinity; they hardly even approach three.
                Here is a small table of results for refractive indices within the range of some real materials:
            </p>

                    <td>f/0.43</td>

            </table>

            <p>
                With a deliberate selection of the highest index flint glass available,
                we see an instance of the infamous f/0.5. Further, the focal length
                <span class="var">f</span>
                determined above was measured from the principal
                plane of the lens, which coincides with its center in this case.
                This means that we cannot take a ball lens higher than
                <span class="var">n</span><span class="sym">=</span><span class="num">2</span>
                (f/0.5)
                while maintaining a requirement that
                <span class="var">f</span>
                <span class="sym">&ge;</span>
                <span class="var">R</span> for imaging. This is one of several good reasons that your camera lens is not
                built using large spherical diamonds.

            <p>
                If the first surface of a diamond ball lens is already "too strong" alone, why
                not simply cut the lens in half to form a planoconvex half ball lens with an external focus?
                Unfortunately, the high refractive index will cause internal reflection to limit the usable aperture.
                It's probably best to move on from diamond now, as this section started with
                motivation from practical lens manufacturing and it is now only narrowly avoiding
                a segue into positive meniscus lenses made of diamond.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this point I must note that mainstream DSLR and mirrorless cameras
                all have their own limits on the maximum usable f-number imposed by the
                mount diameter and flange distance. This limit is around f/1 for
                typical DSLR mounts and around f/0.6 for typical mirrorless mounts.
            </p>

            <p>
                In any event, it's nice to see where f/0.5 came from for spherical glass lenses,
                but most commerical camera lenses now contain at least one aspherical element.
                Can an aspherical lens reach a faster f-number?
            </p>

            <h2>Aspherical Lenses</h2>

            <p>
                The extent of a spherical lens is limited because the curve closes on
                itself. In contrast, a parabolic or hyperbolic surface does not have the same inherent
                limit on diameter; these functions permit computing the height (sag) of a point
                on the lens regardless of how far it is from the center. The practical limit in this
                case is when increasing the diameter further will make a lens too thick. A prolate
                elliptical surface falls in between these two groups, curving more gently than a sphere
                but still re-joining itself to enclose a finite area.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, this spherical lens is very thick and exhibits severe spherical aberration compared to the prolate elliptical version:

            <h3>Homemade Hyperbolic Lenses</h3>

            <p>
                This is a 10 mm f/0.4 planoconvex hyperbolic lens produced using the process I previously described
                <a href="../3d-lenses/index.html">here</a> for producing lenses from a 3D-printed shape:

                Of course, I was also obligated to make my own 50 mm f/0.7 lens. This
                is a single planoconvex hyperbolic lens. It is thinner
                and provides better image quality than a 50 mm f/0.7 spherical
                singlet lens. However, its softness and chromatic aberration pose absolutely no threat to the
                eight element Zeiss lens.

                This lens is made of cast epoxy resin with a refractive index of only about 1.5.
                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_constant">conic constant</a>
                <span class="var">K</span> is about -2.3.

                I haven't made a focus barrel/camera mount for this lens yet, but here a few
                quick handheld freelens shots of a cactus from my 50 mm f/0.7 in front of a
                Nikon F-mount APS-C camera body:

                a planoconvex singlet for use as a telescope objective.
